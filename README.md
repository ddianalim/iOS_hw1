# Climbing Mt. Everest üèîÔ∏è

## Explanations

**What locations/rooms does your game have?**

1. Basecamp
2. Camp I
3. Camp II
4. Camp III
5. Camp IV
6. Sherpa Tent
7. South Summit
8. Hillary Step
9. Summit

**What items does your game have?**

1. Map
2. Weather Radio
3. Oxygen Tank
4. Rope

**Explain how your code is designed. In particular, describe how you used structs or enums, as well as protocols.**

The game is designed using several structs and an enum:

1. `Location` struct: Represents each location in the game, containing properties like name, description, exits, and items.
2. `Item` struct: Represents items that can be picked up and used by the player.
3. `GameState` enum: Tracks the player's progress through the game (e.g., atBasecamp, onMountain, atSummit, descending, gameOver).
4. `EverestGame` struct: The main game struct that implements the `AdventureGame` protocol.

The `GameObject` protocol is used to provide a common interface for both `Location` and `Item` structs, ensuring they both have `name` and `description` properties.

**How do you use optionals in your program?**

Optionals are used in several ways:

1. In the `handle` function, the `argument` is an optional `String?` that may or may not contain additional input from the user.
2. When accessing locations and items, optionals are used with dictionary lookups and array searches, using `if let` and optional chaining to safely unwrap values.
3. The `guard let` statement in the `move` function uses optionals to ensure valid locations and exits exist before allowing movement.

**What extra credit features did you implement, if any?**

* Rich Text Implementation: Added colored and formatted text for key game messages, including:
  - Welcome message: Blue, large serif font
  - Critical warnings and game over messages: Red, large serif font
  - Messages that add new information: Yellow, serif font, size 13. (e.g. "Your inventory is empty", "Available commands")
  - Messages narrating the story: Orange, serif font, size 13. (e.g. "As you start moving...", "As you attempt to descend", "As you bask in your achievement")
  - Messages about actions: Blue, serif font, size 13. (e.g. "You use an oxygen tank", "You check the weather conditions")
  - Summit Achievement + Victory message: Green, large serif font!

This implementation enhances the visual appeal and readability of the game, making important information stand out to the player.
